For each directories, raw files are present.
Run the associated python file to put it into a sqlite3 database.
Note that you can use options in the first part of the python file
to avoid putting data into the database (DB_ACESS_OPTION=0)
Repetitive run of the python file will fill in the sqlite3 db (no uniqueness check)
